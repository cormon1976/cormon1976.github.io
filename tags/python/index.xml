      <description>Introduction. In my previous post I talked about the constructs and various methods and data retrival mechanisms that are available when using a python dictionary.
This post is going to cover some more advanced dictionary topics.
A list of dicts. If we had a list of two dicts like this
In [6]: capital_cities = [{&amp;quot;Ireland&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Dublin&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;England&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;London&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Spain&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Madrid&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;Iran&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Tehran&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Turkey&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Ankara&amp;quot;}] In [7]: capital_cities Out[7]:[{&#39;England&#39;: &#39;London&#39;, &#39;Ireland&#39;: &#39;Dublin&#39;, &#39;Spain&#39;: &#39;Madrid&#39;}, {&#39;Iran&#39;: &#39;Tehran&#39;, &#39;Turkey&#39;: &#39;Ankara&#39;}]  I always find the best way to approach a data structure that is more complex is to study it closely and dissect it piece by piece until you are clear on what type of data structure you are dealing with.</description>

      <description>Introduction. Dictionaries in python are of one of the built-in data type and argueable the most useful one.
You&amp;rsquo;ll hear the name &amp;ldquo;Hash Map&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Arrays&amp;rdquo; also relating to this data structure.
In essence a dictionary or dict is a key, value pairing where each key is unique with the following construction
capital_cities = {&amp;quot;Ireland&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Dublin&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;England&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;London&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Spain&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Madrid&amp;quot;}  Above is a simple dict called capital_cities that contains three keys(countries) and three values(capital city)</description>

      <description>My name is Kevin and I work in Security for a large cloud provider. In my job and in my regular life python seems like it can solve problems. Whether it is finding new devices in a data-center by parsing config file or writing a web app to organize my kids hurling team. What is hurling I hear you ask This is&amp;hellip;
Python seems like it can do many thing and do them well hence I have started and will continue to learn it as a language because as a general purpose languages go it seems like a pretty good one.</description>
